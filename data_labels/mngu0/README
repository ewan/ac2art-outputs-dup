The files contained herein come from forced alignment labelling of
the day1 ema subset of the mngu0 corpus. Two sets of files are
included:

1) Festival utterance structures - the result of front end processing
   using the Festival TTS system, though using the labelling from
   force alignment

2) ESPS format label files, containing just the phone labels and end
   times

In addition, two extra files are included:

mngu0_s1_symbol_list.txt  => text file listing all labelling symbols
mngu0_s1_symbol_table.pdf => description of labelling symbols (pdf)

The Labelling was done using CSTR's MultiSyn voice building tools (a
set of scripts which underlyingly use HTK).  The Combilex lexicon was
used (http://www.cstr.ed.ac.uk/research/projects/combilex/), and phone
labels use the Combilex phoneset (basically an extended SAMPA set)
